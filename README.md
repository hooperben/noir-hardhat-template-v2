# Noir Hardhat Template

This is a developer tool that's intended to help with developing zero knowledge circuits within EVM smart contracts.

### Installation

Bun is super fast - I reckon use it:

```bash
bun install
```

but you can use `npm`, `yarn`, whatever floats your boat.

### Disclaimer

This code is not audited and I don't quite understand some of the moon maths at play. If you're serious about deploying this - please get this looked at by someone who knows what
a Ultra PLONK is.
